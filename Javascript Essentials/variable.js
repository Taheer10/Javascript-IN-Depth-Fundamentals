// or const), a name, and a value

let nr1 = 12;

// var has global scope and let has block scope
// var's global scope means that you can
// use the variables defined with var in the entire script. On the other hand, let's block
// scope means you can only use variables defined with let in the specific block of code
// in which they were defined.
