// Mouse event handlers
// There are different mouse event handlers. Mouse events are actions of the mouse.
// These are the ones we have:
// • ondblclick: when the mouse is double-clicked
// • onmousedown: when the mouse clicks on top of an element without the click
// being released
// • onmouseup: when the mouse click on top of an element is released
// • onmouseenter: when the mouse moves onto an element
// • onmouseleave: when the mouse leaves an element and all of its children
// • onmousemove: when the mouse moves over an element
// • onmouseout: when the mouse leaves an individual element
// • onmouseover: when the mouse hovers over an element
